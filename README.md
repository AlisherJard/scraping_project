# üè†üè¢ Immo Web Scraping Project


## üìú Description
The ImmoEliza Real Estate Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict real estate prices in Belgium. 
This repository contains the first phase of the project, which involves gathering and preprocessing a dataset of at least 10,000 properties from the ImmoWeb website. 
The dataset will be used later as a training set for building the prediction model.
